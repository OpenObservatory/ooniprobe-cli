# OONI Probe CLI

**WARNING** :skull: This is far from being ready for real usage. If you are not a developer, look away :see_no_evil:

The Command Line Interface for running OONI Probe on desktop.

## Developers, developers, developers

You are expected to have a working node installation and yarn.

If that is the case do:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Live reloading will start.

Edit files and run the CLI with:

```
node dist/ooni.js
```
